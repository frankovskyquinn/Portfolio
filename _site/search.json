      "contents": "\nAbout\nMy name is Quinn Frankovsky and I am a recent graduate from Macalester College. I received my bachelors in Geography and Data Science. I grew up in Boulder, CO and played soccer on the Macalester Men’s Soccer Varisty team. I was a teacher assistant for several classes in the Geography Department at Mac, and I will be working as a Geospatial Intern for Traveler’s Insurance in the Summer of 2022. I appreicate the breadth of analysis that GIS and other geospatial softwares provide. I am excited to apply my geospatial and data analysis to my future professional pursuits.\n\n\nProjects\nAssessing the Impacts of Climate Chagne to the Winter Road Industry in N. Canada\nThe aim of this project was to use remote sensing techniques to understand the ways in which climate change impacted and continues to impact the winter road, or ice road, season in Northern Canada. I used NDSI (Normalized Snow Difference Index) values from the MODIS Terra Satellite to compute average NDSI values for a 20 year period. Fluctuations in snow and ice accumulation greatly impact those who use the winter road to survive.\nA picture of a diamond mine on the TCWR, a popular winter road route in N.

I estimated the spatial pattern of breast cancer incidence rates in North Carolina using these variables. I also ran a regression analysis, a univariate local Moran’s I, and a two-tailed, two sample t-test to further investigate these relationships.\nBreast Cancer Incidence Cluster Map, NC\nTwo-Sample t-test to assess statistical significance of poverty variableLink to StoryMap - https://arcg.is/1z4f5O1\n\nAnalysis and Comparison of Formula 1 Circuits\nFor this project, my teammate and I used a handful of different performance and track measurements to compare several of the most popular Formula 1 circuits around the world. We used Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and ArcGIS Pro to create visualizations of each variable and track outline.\nTrack Outline, Variable Performance for the circuit in BelgiumShapefile for Circuit in MonacoLink to StoryMap - https://arcg.is/1GPfaW\n\nElevated Blood Lead Level in Ramsey County, MN\nIn this project, my teammates and I created a risk model that used housing tenure, housing age, and poverty levels to predict census tracts in Ramsey County, Minnesota with elevated blood lead levels. From here, we compared our model to actual EBLL spatial patterns and identified areas in the county with abnormally high blood lead levels compared to their neighboring census tracts.\nOur predictive model compared to actual EBLL patternsClustering of EBLL Patterns in Ramsey CountyLink to StoryMap - https://arcg.is/nzybv\n\n\n\n\n",
